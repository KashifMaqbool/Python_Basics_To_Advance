    "- One main objective of writing code is to make sure it's **readable**.  \n",
    "- Efficiency and readability of code go hand in hand and make you a better programmer.  \n",
    "- [Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP 8)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) provides a set of rules to follow that give a uniform coding convention for Python programmers around the world.  \n",
    "- Good practices include:\n",
    "  - Writing clear documentation (comment blocks and docstrings).  \n",
    "  - Being careful with indentation and whitespace.  \n",
    "  - Using consistent naming conventions for variables and methods.  \n",
